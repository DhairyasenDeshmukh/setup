Steps to Install Spotify on Debian (using Flatpak):

1. Install Flatpak (if not already installed)
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install flatpak -y

2. Add the Flathub repository (Spotify is available there)
   sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

3. Install Spotify from Flathub
   flatpak install flathub com.spotify.Client -y

4. Run Spotify
   flatpak run com.spotify.Client

Note: You may need to log out and log back in after installing Flatpak for it to fully integrate with your system menus.
